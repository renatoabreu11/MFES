# MFES
Repository to host Formal Methods in Software Engineering project.

MFES is a course given at FEUP in the fourth year of the Master in Informatics and Computing Engineering.

Final grade: 19.7/20
 
## Goal
The main focus of our system is to represent and model all the information neces-
sary to manage and visualize Rally Championships, and all the details related to it.

A Rally Championship is a rallying series, consisting of several rallies, culminating
with a champion driver and a team.

Our system allows the management of teams, sponsors, manufacturers, cars and
respective drivers that are participating on a Rally Championship.

A rally, held on a defined location, features a number (typically 15 to 25) of timed
sections - known as special-stages -, which are based on straightforward speed over
closed roads. Normally, it’s organized throughout several days, on the most different
surfaces like asphalt mountain, rough forest tracks, ice and snow or desert sand. Be-
cause of this, competitors visit a service park at pre-determined points to subject the
cars to mechanical work.

The goal of each driver is to complete each stage as quickly as possible. On the
other hand, the driver that completes all the stages in the shortest time is the winner of
that rally.

As a result, our system must be capable of manage the information of each rally
and respective itinerary (service parks, special stage, distances, terrain, etc). Whenever
the rally is happening, it’s also necessary to register the statistics (time, average speed,
penalties) of each driver in a given stage, which consequently defines the leader board.
Automatically, after each Rally Championship, it defines the respective global leader
board.
